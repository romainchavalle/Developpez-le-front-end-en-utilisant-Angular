# OlympicGamesStarter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

Don't forget to install your node_modules before starting (`npm install`).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Where to start

- `components` folder: contains every reusable components
- `pages` folder: contains components used for routing
- `core` folder: contains the business logic (`services` and `models` folders)

I suggest you to start by understanding this starter code. Pay an extra attention to the `app-routing.module.ts` and the `olympic.service.ts`.
